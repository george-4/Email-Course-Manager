This is an Email Correspondence Course Manager written in PHP/SQL/JavaScript. 
It relies on PHPMailer to send emails (PHPMailer files are included).
jQuery UI library is also utilized.

To use it you need to create a MySQL database and import the provided file in 'sql' folder.

Then in 'includes' folder rename 'default.config.inc.php' to 'config.inc.php' and add your database and email info.


Course Manager logic:

We create a cycle and add our students to it. We choose when to send the next lesson to them by choosing the relevant menu option.
Before the cycle ends and these student receive all the lessons we can begin a new cycle with new students.
Each student will always receive the appropriate lesson for his cycle.
We can add a new student mid-cycle and this gives us the option to automatically send him all the lessons he has missed.
When all lessons are sent for a cycle, the cycle deactivates.
All lessons consist of any number of files that are placed in the appropriate folder for each lesson.
These are sent as email attachments to the students.
